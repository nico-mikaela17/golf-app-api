# Golf-app-api
## Create the main scoring table with columns for each hole, out score, in score, and total score.

## Use the golf data API to bring in the data for the golf course(s).

## Create a row that loads yardage, handicap, and par for each hole from the course data and displays it in the table.
The row should have a "total" column for the sum of all 18 holes.

## Create a row to keep track of a player's score. 
This row should allow users to enter their name and a score for each hole. When a user types in a score for a hole, the out, in, and total columns should update.

## Add some CSS to style the card to look like an actual golf card.

## Allow users to select which tee they will be using (Men's, Women's, Pro, Amateur, etc.). All players will play from the same tee.

## Allow up to four players in your scorecard.

## Golf scorecard is responsive (mobile friendly)

## Allow the golfer to select any golf course that is available from the api. 
The scorecard will show the new golf course information (par, yardage, etc.)

## Include ES6 Modules
